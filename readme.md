An API for creating and querying JSON data on different filesystems (local, S3, azure blob, ...). Built for easy use and convenience in small scale projects.  

You can install emmer with the command below. After that, you can run `emmer` and the server will run on 8080 (unless other port is specified). By default, the server will generate a password (see logs) and use the local filesystem at `~/.emmer`.

```console
foo@bar:~$ go install github.com/TimoKats/emmer@latest
foo@bar:~$ emmer -p 1234
```

**An overview of all settings and API endpoints can be found in the documentation on my website.**
